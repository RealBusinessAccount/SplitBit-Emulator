; This is a basic hello world program for the SplitBit CPU.
; We'll create a loop that outputs each byte of our string to Output 0, the text console.

#Program

Start:
  LDA         ; Load a byte of the string into A.
  BRA End     ; If A is zero, branch out of the loop.
  OUTA 0x00   ; Output the value in A to Port 0, the text console.
  INCD        ; Increment the Data Pointer to the next byte of the string.
  BRI Start   ; Branch immediately to the start of the loop.

End:
  INIA 0x0A   ; We'll load a linefeed into A and output it to make it look nice.
  OUTA 0x00   ; Output it to the text console.
  HALT        ; Terminate the program.

#Data

"Hello, World!"
